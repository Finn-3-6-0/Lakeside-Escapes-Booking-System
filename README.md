## 💡 Why I Built This  
Tasked with a school project were a lodge’s outdated system could no longer meet the demands of its growing, experience-focused model. To help Lakeside Lodge run at peak efficiency and recover lost profits, I developed a modern solution that:

- 📅 Tracks each customer’s pod stay duration  
- 💰 Ensures deposit payments are handled accurately  
- 🎟️ Applies relevant discounts based on eligibility  
- 🗓️ Records all bookings in an integrated diary system using a relational database (Microsoft SQL Server) 

This system is built on a **relational database** architecture with a clean Windows Forms-based UI, allowing staff to operate it with **minimal training**. It strikes a balance between functionality, scalability, and ease of use.
